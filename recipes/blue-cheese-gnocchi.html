    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) store-bought or homemade gnocchi</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled blue cheese (such as Gorgonzola or Roquefort)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Gnocchi: Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the gnocchi according to the package
            instructions or until they float to the surface. This usually takes 2-4 minutes. Drain the gnocchi and set
            them aside.</li>
        <li>Make the Blue Cheese Sauce: In a large skillet or pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced
            garlic and saut√© for about a minute until fragrant, but do not let it brown.</li>
        <li>Add the Cream and Blue Cheese: Pour in the heavy cream and stir it into the butter and garlic. Add the
            crumbled blue cheese and continue to stir until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth and
            creamy.</li>
        <li>Combine Gnocchi and Sauce: Gently fold the cooked and drained gnocchi into the blue cheese sauce, making sure they are well coated.

        </li>
        <li>Season and Serve: Taste the gnocchi and sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. The blue cheese can be quite salty, so be cautious with the salt.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: If desired, sprinkle chopped fresh parsley over the top for a touch of color and freshness. Serve the blue cheese gnocchi hot and enjoy your creamy, cheesy dish!</li>
