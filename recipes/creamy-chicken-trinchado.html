    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creamy Chicken Trinchado is a delightful fusion of South African and Portuguese flavors, combining the spicy kick
        of trinchado sauce with the comfort of a creamy chicken base. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h2>For the Chicken Trinchado:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds (680g) boneless, skinless chicken breast or thigh, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Trinchado spice mix (adjust to your preferred level of spiciness)</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>For the Trinchado Spice Mix:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground chili powder (adjust for spice)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Trinchado Spice Mix: In a small bowl, combine all the spice mix ingredients. Adjust the chili
            powder to your desired level of spiciness.</li>
        <li>Cook the Chicken: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chopped chicken pieces
            and cook until they are browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet
            and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Make the Creamy Trinchado Sauce: In the same skillet, add more oil if needed, and then add the finely
            chopped onion. Saut√© the onion until it's soft and translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and
            cook for an additional minute, or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Spice it Up: Sprinkle the trinchado spice mix over the onion and garlic, stirring to coat the mixture
            evenly. Cook for a minute to release the flavors.</li>
        <li>Create the Creamy Base: Pour in the chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the
            skillet. Add the heavy cream, salt, and black pepper. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Simmer and Thicken: Let the sauce simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until it thickens and reduces slightly.</li>
        <li>Return the Chicken: Add the cooked chicken pieces back to the skillet, coating them with the creamy
            trinchado sauce. Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes until the chicken is heated through.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Garnish your Creamy Chicken Trinchado with fresh cilantro if desired. Serve it hot,
            ideally over cooked rice or with warm crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.</li>
