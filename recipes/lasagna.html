    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h2>For the Meat Sauce:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>For the Cheese Filling:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 ounces (425g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Layers:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles, cooked and drained</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese for topping</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese for topping</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped
            onion and minced garlic and sauté for a few minutes until the onion is soft and translucent. Drain any
            excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce. Add the dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and
            pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust the seasonings as
            needed.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper.

        </li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place three lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add half of the cheese mixture and spread it evenly over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers by adding three more noodles, the remaining cheese mixture, and more meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Place the final three noodles on top and cover with the remaining meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and a generous amount of grated Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly to avoid touching the cheese. This will prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly, and the cheese is golden and melted.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows it to set, making it easier to serve.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired, and enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
